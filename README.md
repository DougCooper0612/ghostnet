# GHOSTnet

## What is GHOSTnet?

**GHOSTnet** is an email and message network, for BBSes that support FTN and or WWIV networking platforms, with a goal to stir up creativity and further enhance modern BBS experiences, focused on the future of BBSing and growing user activity.

### About GHOSTnet
In 2020, many returned to BBSing to escape social media, forming lifelong friendships. As life returned to "normal", we aim to prevent the decline of BBS activity (again). GHOSTnet wants to keep the community alive by bridging the gap between the old and new while fostering collaboration and non-toxic conversation.

We don't aim to replace networks like FsxNet or WWIVnet but to supplement them with a non silo'ed approach toward collaboration and development in an effore to growg the BBS community through innovation, fun, and unique conversation that suppliments your current network portfolio.

**GHOSTNet** is for ANY SysOP of ANY BBS platform with unique added "benefits" for those super stars runnning WWIV or Talisman BBSes.  WWIV and Talisman BBSes can host ones own message areas / subboards without needing special permission from a network admin/owner, as long as they follow the network rules. This feature delivers more power to the SysOp and their users to freely create unique, private, public, and even annonymous message areas that meet the needs of your theme and atmosphere.  With our custom created GHOSTUP network tool, we can ping these BBSes, update a master sub.lst, and deliver a freshly updated list to you monthly, allowing others to discover the great new topics you've created as public offerings.  Note: If you'd like to experience this awesome WWIV networking feature, fire up a Talisman or WWIV BBS and we'll give you your FTN node for your main BBS, and a WWIV networking node for your new Talisman or WWIV BBS!  

## GHOSTnet Goals:
1. Bridge WWIV network to FTNs for all BBS Software Platforms and their users.
2. Through creative core topic offerings, cater to a broad audience, including a new generation of BBS users and topics of interst to them.
3. Inspire SysOps, developers, artists, and users to grow the GhostNet BBS community.
4. Provide bring to the surface a place to promote your BBS Events, Content Creation, Multi-BBS / User Game Competition Starts / Resets.
5. Encourage modern BBS features through mods, coding, and customization tips that benefit a wide variety of BBS software platforms collectively.
6. Have fun and support one another without overlapping discussion topics found on other networks!
7. Help new SysOps who have been Ghosted! with learning the hobby, the software, or how to add our super fun network!

## Requirements:
1. Your BBS is capable of running an Fido (FTN) AND OR WWIV based network.
2. Your BBS should be customized, not stock, unless a developer -- and or you are in the process of and active in customzing your BBS.
3. Your BBS must be up for at least 90 days to keep the admins focused on collaborating on goals (Devs are the exception to the rule).
4. No BBS ads or messages set to events or auto-added.  There are enough FTN's with BBS Ad sections left unread.
5. Be kind and promote free speech while avoiding illegal content and unecessary drama and conflict. 
6. No spam.
7. WWIV and Talisman SysOps are encouraged to host relevant "initial offering" subs.

### About WWIV networking:

**WWIV networking** is a BBS-based network using WWIVâ€™s message and network system, similar to FTN networks. Any sysop can create a message/topic and allow others to subscribe. WWIVnet fosters collaboration, free speech, and a customizable experience for BBS sysops and users.

### Bridging Between WWIVNet and FTN Networks

One of GHOSTnet's unique features is the ability to **bridge** messages between WWIVnet and FTN-based networks using Talisman BBS. Talisman allows importing and exporting messages between these two systems, ensuring consistent communication across both network types. This seamless integration lets BBSes maintain the structure and benefits of WWIVnet while also participating in the larger FTN ecosystem, making it easier for sysops to manage and interact with users from both networks. 

This bridging capability helps unify the BBS community, allowing for cross-network discussions without losing the unique strengths of either system.

#### Notes on Bridging:
- FTN and WWIVnet-based subs will have a "common" base for all
- Self-hosted subs may intially only be availible for WWIV and Talisman sysops
- Self-hosted subs may be added to the FTN on a case-by-case basis (it's a manual process right now)
