## What the Heck is GHOSTnet?
**GHOSTnet** No fear, we're just here to add some excitement into your life!  
We are a shiny new email and message network for Bulletin Board Systems (BBSes) running on the WWIV network platform for WWIV BBSes, that then bridge to FTN for all GHOSTnet subscribers to enjoy, regardless of your choice of 
BBS Software.   

##About GHOSTnet
In 2020 many returned to BBSing to escape the toxicity of social media during difficult times for our world. Many life long friendships were made, reminding each of us that BBSing is not a museum, rather a timeless
avenue of genuine friendships and fun.  Fast forwarding to 2024 and the "return to normal" left a bit of dust on the dashboard of great BBSes and FTN's alike, as SysOps and users return to the everyday grind of life.
So let's stir the pot, get out the armorall and shine up the BBS's, shall we?  If ya wouldn't abandon your family and friends, get back to your BBS!

Why another network?  We don't want to create a replacement for great networks ranging from FsxNet to WWIVnet ... We want to be an suppliment and grow.

GHOSTnet Goals:
1.  Experiment with the WWIV network, bridging to FTNs, so all users can enjoy.
2.  Serve up topics great for all ages, some actually teenage approved, to reach a broader audience of users than just GenX and Boomers.
3.  Inspire sysops, developers, artists, and users to work together to attract/draw and build a larger BBS community in a forward thinking manner. 
4.  Support, encourage, and create BBS features through mods and coding that continue to modernize the world of BBSing in a non cookie cutter way.
4.  To play, have fun, and be there for one another!

##Requirements
1.  Your BBS must be customized and not a stock BBS unless in active development as the author and or beta tester.
2.  Your BBS must be up for a minimum of 90 days to prevent unecessary add/removes.
3.  NO BBS Ads set to events.  We have enough of those right?  Build a tagline, people will come.
4.  Be kind to one another.
5.  Value and protect free speech not censorship with the obvious exception of threats to person or property or other illegal forms of speech.
6.  No Spam.
7.  WWIV and Talisman SysOps are encouraged to make subs they have time to host:  keep on topic as best as possible,

### More about WWIVnet, in which GHOSTnet runs on:

**WWIVnet** is a WWIV BBS-based network that uses WWIV's message and network packet system to share email and sub messages. Similar to the many FidoNet Technology-based networks (FTN), there are numerous WWIVnet-based networks.

WWIV was a very popular BBS softare package in the 80's to early 2000's, that as of 2024 is still in development.  WWIV's incredible feature set adds since 2020 deserve some love and showcase.  
WWIV has always been open source, and to date has it's own non-FTN style network system called WWIVnet.  The advantage to WWIVnet is that any SysOp can create their own WWIVnet message/topic and 
allow others to subscribe to it, all from their own BBS, while also subscribe to message areas (subs) that others within the network create.  A "Subs List" will routinely be made available for for 
everyone to review "whats new."  In addition, the SysOp can set whether they want to auto validate or individually approve other SysOps wanting to subscribe to their "topic" of discussion.  

##About WWIVnet From BBS Wiki Fandom
"In it's prime WWIVnet represented 1700 systems, however it's popularity wasn't without its share of controversy. To quite a few non-WWIV sysops, using WWIV was a sign of rebellion against the 
status quo; in fact, several key FIDOnet administrators were quoted on several occasions that they firmly believed that running a WWIV board meant that you were probably running a 
"pirate" or "hacker" BBS, and that no WWIV BBS should be allowed access to FIDOnet. This would lead to Bell's creation of WWIVnet in 1988, which at its peak became was the world's largest 
proprietary BBS network, and while the total number of systems never exceeded 1700, the sheer amount of traffic passed over the network was almost double that of FIDOnet for almost a two year period 
between 1991 and 1993. Much of the traffic difference can easily be attributed to WWIVnet's general acceptance of Freedom of Speech as a right and not a privilege, something that many FIDOnet forum 
admins could not acknowledge, and even let abuse of the right get way out of hand on more occasions than the scope of this entry could account for."

Controversy existed within the WWIV Universe as well with the inception of WWIVlink, which did not require a WWIV registration number to be a part of, unlike WWIVnet.  A third appeared that was 
near and dear to the heart of any Text Mode Art Loving BBS User:  ICEnet.  All three networks were based on the WWIV netkworking system and not FTN.    

WWIVnet 1700 systems
IceNET 850 systems
WWIVlink 675 systems

#### How to Join via WWIVnet

If you want to join GHOSTnet using the WWIVnet system (WWIV and Talisman), check out the documentation:
- [WWIV Documentation](https://docs.wwivbbs.org)
- [Talisman Documentation](https://talismanbbs.com/docs)

**Note:** For GHOSTnet, "WWIVnet" refers to WWIV's message and packet system, not the network called WWIVnet.

### WWIV BBS

WWIV BBS supports both Fido Technology Network (FTN) and the traditional WWIVnet style networking. If you're running a WWIV BBS, here are some cool advantages of using WWIVNet over FTN:

- **Well-documented:** Easy to set up and add subs.
- **User Flexibility:** Allows any user to create and host/moderate their own subs, potentially running their own sub-network, as long as it adheres to GHOSTnet's rules and terms of service.

### OK, what's a FidoNet Technology Network (FTN)?

**FidoNet** is a worldwide computer network used for communication between BBSes. It's still active! "FTN" refers to networks following the FidoNet standard, not the actual network called FidoNet.

### Crap, which Network Should I Join?

Still deciding? Each network has its own perks, so consider what fits your needs best. Whether you choose WWIVnet or FTN, GHOSTnet brings everyone together!
