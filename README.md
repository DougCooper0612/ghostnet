# GHOSTnet

Welcome to **GHOSTnet** â€“ the email and message network for Bulletin Board Systems (BBSes). GHOSTnet bridges WWIVnet and FTN, merging messages from both into a single, unified system. Here's what you need to know:

## WWIVnet

**WWIVnet** is a WWIV BBS-based network that uses WWIV's message and network packet system to share email and sub messages. Similar to the many FidoNet Technology-based networks (FTN), there are numerous WWIVnet-based networks.

### How to Join via WWIVnet

If you want to join GHOSTnet using the WWIVnet system (WWIV and Talisman), check out the documentation:
- [WWIV Documentation](https://docs.wwivbbs.org)
- [Talisman Documentation](https://talismanbbs.com/docs)

**Note:** For GHOSTnet, "WWIVnet" refers to WWIV's message and packet system, not the network called WWIVnet.

## WWIV BBS

WWIV BBS supports both Fido Technology Network (FTN) and the traditional WWIVnet style networking. If you're running a WWIV BBS, here are some cool advantages of using WWIVNet over FTN:

- **Well-documented:** Easy to set up and add subs.
- **User Flexibility:** Allows any user to create and host/moderate their own subs, potentially running their own sub-network, as long as it adheres to GHOSTnet's rules and terms of service.

## FidoNet Technology Network (FTN)

**FidoNet** is a worldwide computer network used for communication between BBSes. It's still active! "FTN" refers to networks following the FidoNet standard, not the actual network called FidoNet.

## Which Network Should I Join?

Still deciding? Each network has its own perks, so consider what fits your needs best. Whether you choose WWIVnet or FTN, GHOSTnet brings everyone together!
