## What the Heck is GHOSTnet?
**GHOSTnet** is an email and message network for Bulletin Board Systems (BBSes). It bridges WWIVnet and FTN, merging messages from both into a single, unified system. Here's what you need to know:

## About GHOSTnet
There are quite a few networks out there, often covering broad BBS and retro topics. These networks are cool (we're members), but they also tend to cover a lot of the same ground. We don't want to create a replacement for fsxNet or WWIVnet or whatever... At GHOSTnet, we think modern tech is also cool and can make old tech even more fun and interesting. And vice versa -- so let's cover both. That's our angle.

So, here are some topics you might find on GHOSTnet:
- **AI and Global Communication:** Exploring new mediums to share data across multiple platforms as alternatives to the web.
- **Preparedness for Real Events:** Discussions on homesteading, gardening, canning, storm preparedness, and inflation-proofing.
- **Modern Gaming Systems:** Reviews, news, and site updates.
- **PC Hardware Developments:** Beyond Raspberry Pi, exploring microcomputing advancements.
- **White Hats and HPAVC:** Cybersecurity insights.
- **Current Tech-Related Events:** Updates on what's happening in tech: personalities, controversies and other tech-centric news and happenings.
- **Comics, Anime, and RPGs:** Deeper dives into these exciting worlds.
- **Vintage + Modern Computing:** Old computers rigged with new hardware, software 

In short, we'll cover interesting topics, ensuring it's not just the same ol' same ol' rinse and repeat! Not to mention the ability for members to create their own subs.


### Wait, what is WWIVnet?

**WWIVnet** is a WWIV BBS-based network that uses WWIV's message and network packet system to share email and sub messages. Similar to the many FidoNet Technology-based networks (FTN), there are numerous WWIVnet-based networks.

#### How to Join via WWIVnet

If you want to join GHOSTnet using the WWIVnet system (WWIV and Talisman), check out the documentation:
- [WWIV Documentation](https://docs.wwivbbs.org)
- [Talisman Documentation](https://talismanbbs.com/docs)

**Note:** For GHOSTnet, "WWIVnet" refers to WWIV's message and packet system, not the network called WWIVnet.

### WWIV BBS

WWIV BBS supports both Fido Technology Network (FTN) and the traditional WWIVnet style networking. If you're running a WWIV BBS, here are some cool advantages of using WWIVNet over FTN:

- **Well-documented:** Easy to set up and add subs.
- **User Flexibility:** Allows any user to create and host/moderate their own subs, potentially running their own sub-network, as long as it adheres to GHOSTnet's rules and terms of service.

### OK, what's a FidoNet Technology Network (FTN)?

**FidoNet** is a worldwide computer network used for communication between BBSes. It's still active! "FTN" refers to networks following the FidoNet standard, not the actual network called FidoNet.

### Crap, which Network Should I Join?

Still deciding? Each network has its own perks, so consider what fits your needs best. Whether you choose WWIVnet or FTN, GHOSTnet brings everyone together!
