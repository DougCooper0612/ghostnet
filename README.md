# GHOSTnet

## What is GHOSTnet?

**GHOSTnet** is an email and message network for BBSes, designed for fun and to enhance your modern BBS experience.

### About GHOSTnet
In 2020, many returned to BBSing to escape social media, forming lifelong friendships. As life returned to "normal", we aim to prevent the decline of BBS activity (again). GHOSTnet wants to keep the community alive by bridging the gap between the old and new while fostering collaboration and non-toxic conversation.

We don't aim to replace networks like FsxNet or WWIVnet but to supplement them, growing the BBS community through innovation and fun.

**GHOSTNet** also allows sysops running WWIV or Talisman BBSes to host their own subs without needing special permission from a network admin/owner, as long as they follow the network rules. This gives sysops the freedom to create unique message areas and topics, fostering diverse and rich discussions. Note: this self-hosting sub  flexibility is only available to sysops using WWIV or Talisman platforms, making it a powerful tool for those seeking to build and grow their BBS communities.

## GHOSTnet Goals:

1. Bridge WWIV network to FTNs for all users.
2. Cater to a broad audience, including teens.
3. Inspire sysops, developers, and users to grow the BBS community.
4. Encourage modern BBS features through mods and coding.
5. Have fun and support one another!

## Requirements:

1. Your BBS should be customized, not stock.
2. Your BBS must be up for at least 90 days.
3. No BBS ads set to events.
4. Be kind and promote free speech while avoiding illegal content.
5. No spam.
6. WWIV and Talisman SysOps are encouraged to host relevant subs.

### About WWIVnet:

**WWIVnet** is a BBS-based network using WWIVâ€™s message and network system, similar to FTN networks. Any sysop can create a message/topic and allow others to subscribe. WWIVnet fosters collaboration, free speech, and a customizable experience for BBS sysops and users.

### Bridging Between WWIVNet and FTN Networks

One of GHOSTnet's unique features is the ability to **bridge** messages between WWIVnet and FTN-based networks using Talisman BBS. Talisman allows importing and exporting messages between these two systems, ensuring consistent communication across both network types. This seamless integration lets BBSes maintain the structure and benefits of WWIVnet while also participating in the larger FTN ecosystem, making it easier for sysops to manage and interact with users from both networks. 

This bridging capability helps unify the BBS community, allowing for cross-network discussions without losing the unique strengths of either system.
